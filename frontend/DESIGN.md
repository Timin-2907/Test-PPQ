## Brand & Style

The design system is engineered to evoke the high-stakes, immersive atmosphere of a premium cinema lobby. The brand personality is bold, sophisticated, and technologically advanced, bridging the gap between traditional film aesthetics and future-forward AI discovery. 

The visual style employs a **Dark Mode Cinematic** approach, utilizing high-contrast accents against abyssal backgrounds. It leverages **Glassmorphism** and **Subtle Glows** to simulate the effect of neon theater signage and back-lit digital kiosks. Surfaces feel like polished obsidian—glossy yet functional—providing a luxury stage for vibrant film artwork.

## Colors

This design system is anchored in a true-black environment to maximize the "pop" of movie posters and red interactive elements. 

- **Primary (Cinematic Red):** Used exclusively for high-priority calls to action, active states, and critical information. It should be treated as a light source.
- **Backgrounds:** Pure black (#000000) is the base canvas. Dark Gray (#121212) is used for secondary sections to provide subtle structure.
- **Surfaces:** Darker Slate (#1F1F1F) acts as the foundation for cards and inputs, providing enough contrast against the background to define depth without needing heavy borders.
- **Typography:** Pure White for headlines to ensure maximum readability; Light Gray for secondary metadata to maintain visual hierarchy.

## Typography

The typographic system balances the editorial impact of **Montserrat** with the functional precision of **Inter**.

- **Headlines:** Set in Montserrat with tight letter-spacing to mimic movie title treatments. Use Bold (700) for primary headers to command attention.
- **Body:** Inter provides neutral, highly legible reading for synopses and showtimes.
- **Labels:** Small caps or uppercase transformations are encouraged for category labels (e.g., GENRE, RATING) to create a structured, "data-rich" look familiar to AI interfaces.

## Layout & Spacing

The layout follows a 12-column fluid grid on desktop, transitioning to a single-column stacked view on mobile. 

- **Breathing Room:** Use generous vertical padding (64px+) between sections to maintain a premium, cinematic feel.
- **Aspect Ratios:** Movie posters should strictly follow a 2:3 ratio, while hero banners use a wide 21:9 or 16:9 ratio to mimic theatrical screens.
- **AI Feed:** Discovery feeds should use an asymmetrical masonry or staggered grid to suggest dynamic, AI-generated curation rather than a static list.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth is communicated through **Glassmorphism** and **Luminescence** rather than traditional drop shadows.

- **Level 1 (Base):** Pure black background.
- **Level 2 (Cards):** #1F1F1F with a subtle 1px inner border (white at 10% opacity) to simulate a glass edge.
- **Level 3 (Modals/Overlays):** Semi-transparent background blur (32px) with a dark tint, allowing the movie artwork underneath to bleed through.
- **Luminescence:** Interactive elements use a "Red Glow" effect—a soft, primary-colored outer shadow (blur: 20px, spread: -5px, opacity: 0.3) to suggest the element is emitting light.

## Shapes

The shape language is "Soft-Modern." All primary containers, buttons, and posters utilize a **12px to 16px corner radius**. This softens the high-contrast color palette, making the interface feel approachable and high-end rather than aggressive or industrial. 

- **Posters:** 12px radius.
- **Buttons:** 12px radius for standard, 32px (pill) for secondary tags.
- **Inputs:** 12px radius.

## Components

### Buttons
- **Primary:** Cinematic Red background, white text. On hover: Scale 1.05x and add a red glow effect.
- **Secondary:** Transparent with a 1.5px white border. On hover: Background becomes white at 10% opacity.

### Cards (Movie/Showtime)
- Surfaces should have a glossy finish. Use a subtle gradient transition from bottom (black) to top (transparent) over movie posters to ensure text overlay readability.

### Chips & Tags
- Used for genres (e.g., "Sci-Fi", "IMAX"). Pill-shaped with a Darker Slate (#1F1F1F) background and Light Gray text.

### Inputs
- Background: #121212. Border: 1px #1F1F1F. On focus: Border changes to Cinematic Red with a faint red glow.

### AI Recommendations
- Special "AI Choice" cards should feature a subtle, animated gradient border using a mix of Cinematic Red and a deep violet to distinguish them from standard listings.

### Lists
- For showtimes, use a horizontal scrolling row of "Time Chips." Active time chips should be Cinematic Red; inactive chips should be outlined.
